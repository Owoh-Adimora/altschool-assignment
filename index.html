                <p>
                    I was born on June 16, 1996, in Okunino village, Udi town, Enugu state, Nigeria. Growing up in a modest household, I exhibited an early curiosity for learning. My parents nurtured my inquisitive nature, fostering an environment where questions were encouraged, and knowledge was celebrated.

                <p>
                    I completed my O'level education at "Good Shepherd Anglican Seminary, Enugu", where I excelled in academics and extracurricular activities. I finished O'level in 2015 and gained admission to the Institute of Management and Technology Enugu, where I studied mass communication.

                    <h2>Reason for Joining the School</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    I chose to join AltSchool Africa because of its excellent reputation in engineering and its commitment to fostering a culture of creativity and problem-solving. I have always had a passion for technology and innovation, and from the information gathered about AltSchool Africa, I believe I stand a chance to enhance my skills towards tech to provide solutions to issues facing society at large through technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though I have no background knowledge of tech or anything related to tech, as my core discipline is Communication Art (specifically Mass Communication), seeing how the world has evolved towards tech, I decided to opt for software engineering. The best and easiest way to achieve my goal is by enrolling in a credible and well-profiled institution like AltSchool Africa.
